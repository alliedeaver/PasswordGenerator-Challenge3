# PasswordGenerator-Challenge3
## Description
Given the starter code, the password generator was missing multiple steps in the javascript file. This password generator is now able to generate a password given that the user provides correct information. Things like password length within a parameter, special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters are all options that the user has for their random password. 
## Process and materials
The files given were HTML, JavaScript, and CSS stylesheets. Given my lack of experience with javascript, I utilized MDN webdocs, and sought a tutoring session for extra help. I also collaborated with more experienced classmates who helped explain the processes and functions.
